# Libary

Built mainly to Practice my Object Constructor Skills in JavaScript,
Used HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

Steps:
- All of the books objects were to be stored in a simple array, I added a function to the script that takes the user's input
and stores the new book Objects into an array.
- Wrote a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page, each on their own "Card".
- Associated my DOM elements with the actual book objects by giving them data attrivute that corresponds to the index
of the libary array.
