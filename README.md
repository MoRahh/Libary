# Libary

A Simple Website I built to practice my JavaScript Foundation.
Used HTML/CSS/VanillaJS

Steps:
- Created a page with 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript.
- Added a hover effect so that the grid changes color when the mouse hovers over it,leaving a pixelated trail through the grid like a pen would.
- Created a button that will ask the user about the number of squares, Once entered the existing grid is removed and a new grid is generated in the same total space as before.
